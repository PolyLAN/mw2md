# RICK Documentation

## Configuration of the RICK

This section provides detailed information about the configuration of the
different components of the RICK. The target group of this sections are
persons that need to setup and/or configure the RICK Infrastructure (e.g.
Developers or OSGI Administrators).

  * '''The [basic Setup](RickInstallation#Configuring_RICK)''' (see [Installation](RickInstallation))''':''' Explains the minimal configuration needed to run the RICK 
  * '''[Rick Main Configuration](RickConfiguration):''' Provides detailed information about the options for the global configuration of the RICK 
  * '''[Referenced Sites](ReferencedSiteConfiguration):''' Describes the necessary steps to link referenced sites with the RICK. 
  * '''[Yards](YardConfiguration):''' Yards are the storage components of the RICK. The RICK can use several Yards and also provides different implementations based on different storage technologies. 
    * '''[ClerezzaYard](ClerezzaYardConfiguration):''' A RDF Triple Store Yard implementation based on [http://incubator.apache.org/clerezza Clerezza]. SPARQL is used for queries. 
    * '''[SolrYard](SolrYardConfiguration):''' A Yard Implementation based on the [http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ Solr] Search Server. 
  * '''Local [Caches](CacheConfiguration):''' A cache is a wrapper over a Yard that allows to configure what information are cached locally. 
  * '''Entity Import and [Representation Mappings](RepresentationMapping):''' When importing information from referenced sites one needs to filter, validate, align such information.

## Architecture of the RICK

This section describes the architecture of the RICK and all the main
components. The target group for this section are developers that want to use
the Java API of the RICK as well as developers that plan the extend the RICK
(e.g. by providing there own implementation RICK services).

  * '''[High Level View](RickArchitecture):''' This describes how to use the core component of RICK without going into to much details.
  * '''The [Rick Model](RickDataModel):''' This explains the data model used by the RICK (and why there are no Entities defined in this data model ;)
  * '''[Components of the Rick](ComponentsOfTheRick):''' This sections describes details of the components defined by RICK
    * '''[Rick](ComponentRick):''' This component is the central access point for all information managed by the Rick.
    * '''[ReferencedSiteManager](ComponentReferencedSiteManager):''' This manager component allows to work with all referenced sites via a central access point.
    * '''[ReferencedSite](ComponentReferencedSite):''' This components is the local access point for a referenced site (an entity information source that is linked with the RICK)
    * '''[EntityDereferencer](ComponentEntityDereferencer) and [EntitySearcher](ComponentEntitySearcher):''' Implementations of this interfaces are used by the [ReferencedSite](ComponentReferencedSite) to dereference entity information and to search for entities based on parsed [queries](RickQuery)
    * '''[Yard](ComponentYard):''' This component is used to store all kind of information that is managed by the RICK or locally cached for referenced sites
    * '''[Cache](ComponentCache):''' This component is implemented as a wrapper over [Yard](ComponentYard) but allows to define via [mappings](RepresentationMapping) to control what information are cached locally for entities loaded from the remote site.
  * '''[Query API](RickQuery):''' In future RICK will define several different query types. This section will explain when and how to use the different query types.

## [[RickRESTfullApi|RESTful Interface]] of the RICK

This Section provides Information about the Web-Services API of the Rick and
is intended for Developers that plan to use the RICK via its RESTful Services
API.

The RICK supports three Service Endpoints:

  1. '''[SITES endpoint](RickRESTfullApi#SITES_Service_Endpoint_.22.2Fsites.22):''' This endpoint can be used to access all referenced sites via a single URI. It also provides services to retrieve meta data about referenced sites.
  2. '''[SITE endpoint](RickRESTfullApi#SITE_Service_Endpoint_.22.2Fsite.2F.7BsiteID.7D.22):''' This endpoint allows to interact with a specific referenced site. Calls take advantage of local caches (if available)
  3. '''[RICK endpoint](RickRESTfullApi#RICK_Endpoint_.28.22.2Fsymbol.22_and_.22.2Fmapping.22.29):''' This endpoint allows to work with the Entities managed by the RICK (called Symbols) and mappings of external Entities to Symbols. 

## Web Interface of the RICK

Not yet implemented :(
